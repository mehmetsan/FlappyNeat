# FlappyNeat
An implementation of NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) on the classic Flappy Bird game in Python

# About
A program using Reinforcement Learning to simulate the learning process of playing Flappy Bird perfectly. After creating a look-alike of the popular Flappy Bird game on Python, I read the article on NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) by Kenneth O. Stanley and wanted to work on a similar implementation for my game along with the help from online tutorials. The simulation displays each bird in a generation until every single one of them fails, after which, the next generation of birds start. The program learns to play (keeps going) after the second generation.
